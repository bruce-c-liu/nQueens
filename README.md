# nQueens

Implements and uses a hashing function and horizontal symmetry to optimize the classic nQueens problem. 
Solves all solutions for 18 queens in around 66 minutes on an average pc. 

TO-DO:

1. Use bitwise operators to massively increase speed.
2. Use more types of symmetry.
3. Use multi-threading.
4. Find more cases where algorithm does not search dead-ends.

Find the implementation under nQueens/src/solvers.js.
