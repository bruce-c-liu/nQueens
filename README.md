# nQueens

Implements and uses a hashing function and horizontal symmetry to optimize the classic nQueens problem. 
Solves all solutions for 18 queens in around 66 minutes on an average pc. 

TODO: 
#Use bitwise operators to massively increase speed.
#Use more types of symmetry.

Find the implementation under nQueens/src/solvers.js.
